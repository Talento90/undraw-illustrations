## JSON data

`undraw.json` - scraped JSON data with remote links to the CDN images.

`undraw-local.json` - similar to `undraw.json`, but with the filenames of the locally stored images. Images are under `svg` directory, so make sure to join the path or move this file into `svg`.

The JSON data also contains keys for the Title and Tags associated with each image.

## Images

The images are all from Undraw, and are not mine at all. They are all in SVG format, and placed under the `svg` directory.

## Credits

All credits go to Undraw, this work is not mine. Just as the original Undraw project, this repo is also MIT licensed!

Check out their work on their website! This repo is just a mirror, while their website has much cooler features (including a nice display and search function!)
